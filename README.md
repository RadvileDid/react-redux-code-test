### Idea behind it

For the last year I have been working in the company as a front-end developer and to complete daily tasks I was using React with Flow and GraphQL. However, I wanted to expand my knowledge and created this project as an exercise to showcase newly learned Redux and Typescript.

As a task, I also had wireframes which I choose to visualise using [Ant Design](https://ant.design/). Below are the wireframes the project was based on:

### Commands

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and the following commands are required to run it:

- yarn start watch

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- yarn run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
